# Visual vs Auditory Lexical Decision in Russian: Modality Makes Sense 
The data and code for two Russian Lexical decision task experiments in visual and auditory modalities

## Abstract
_Lexical decision task_ is one of the most wide-spread methods used is psycholinguistic experiments, performed in either visual or auditory modality. The comparability of results acquired in the two modalities, however, has only recently received attention. In this paper, we present the results of two parallel experiments, one in the visual modality and one in the auditory modality, run on the same lexical material (words and pseudo-words). The reaction time distributions differ between the two modalities: mean reaction time is longer in the auditory modality. Mean reaction time for pseudo-words in significantly longer the mean reaction time for real words.
